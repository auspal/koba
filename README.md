# Kobayakawa

[Kobayakawa](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/142325/kobayakawa) 
([rules](http://www.iellogames.com/downloads/Kobayakawa_rules.pdf)) is a Japanese micro-game 
that is has simple rules and only a few components.  This app recreates a single game which 
lasts 7 rounds.

**TODO:**
- correctly determine new start player instead of always using player1 each round
- handle situation where two players tie with highest total at the end of a round
- eliminate player from game if they run out of kamons to bet with
